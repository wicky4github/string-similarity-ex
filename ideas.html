            <ul>
                <li>1. Get the best match between the correct sentence and the user's reading sentence. (There has been already a nice algorithm from "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity">https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity</a>" to compare two strings. However, I can't know which word is correct by using this algorithm.)</li>
